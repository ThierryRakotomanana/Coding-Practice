# LINKED LIST

## What is Linked List
A linked list is a collection of entities which are not stored in sequential order. Instead, each entity has a pointer to the next entity. Each entity, also referred to as a node, is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

## The main operations on linked lists are

• prepend - add a node to the beginning of the list
• append - add a node to the end of the list
• delete - remove a node from the list
• deleteTail - remove the last node from the list
• deleteHead - remove the first node from the list
• find - find a node in the list

## Applications
A linked list is used as a good foundation for many other data structures like queues, stacks and hash tables. The linked list implementation we will create in JavaScript will be used for many of the other data structures we will learn about in this book.
